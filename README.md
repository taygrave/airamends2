# AIR AMENDS 2
This project is the re-build of my first complete project [AirAmends](https://github.com/taygrave/AirAmends) built in 2015. I decided to rebuild it to highlight the new tech I've since learned in my last nearly three years as a professional web developer. Please use this repo as an example of my current coding profciency and style, as well as a comparison with the 2015 version to see how much I can learn in a few short years.  

## Technologies
This app was built off the [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) starter template, which is comprised of the following notable technologies:
- React
- Redux
- Babel
- Webpack
- Browsersync
- Jest
- [and more](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)

### Modifications & Additions
I modified the original starter kit to also include Flow for static type checking, and to lint with Standard vs. ESLint.

Furthermore, my particular project also requires:
- Google OAuth
- Gmail API
- MapBox
- React Bootstrap

## Purpose
Giving air travelers visibility into their carbon footprint. After linking their gmail, an interactive report details the user's personal air travel over the last few years and the associated social cost of the carbon emissions estimated from each flight. The user is also presented with an personal map animating their flights and is given an option to donate away their personal carbon debt to the environmental organization of their choicee.
